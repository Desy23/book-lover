        <p>Hey there! Welcome to my book blog. I'm Destiny but you can call me Des.
            As a child growing up, I always enjoyed reading books and writing stories.
            But as I got older, there were other things that took my attention away from reading
            such as my education. However, I still read at least one book every now and
            again. Then, the pandemic came and I had a lot of free time on my hands so with that,
            I rekindled my love for reading. Now, I'm reading more than ever and I'm loving it.
            Plus, I can't seem to stop buying books. I'm a book hoarder and a huge sucker for
            pretty cover books. I am convinced that reading books and buying books are two separate
            hobbies.</br></br> In rekindling my love for reading, I discovered authors such as Angie Thomas,
            Nic Stone, Holly Jackson, Karen McManus, Brigid Kemmerer, and one of my absolute favourites,
            Colleen Hoover. Found on this blog, you will see the books I have read in the different genres,
            as well as the ratings I gave them, and another section will have the books I definitely
            think you should read.
